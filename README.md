# ParSPICE Kotlin Template
A basic outline for a Groovy Gradle parspice project in Kotlin. This assumes that the ParSPICE library is installed
and published to the Maven Local repo (see the [main project's readme](https://github.com/JoelCourtney/parspice) for details).

The relevant code can be found in `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt`, `src/worker/kotlin/MyWorker.kt`, and `build.gradle`.

All other files where generated as-is from a new Gradle Groovy Kotlin project in IntelliJ.

A `gradle run` task has been added for convenience.
