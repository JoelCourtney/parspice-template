# ParSPICE Java Template
A basic outline for a Gradle Groovy parspice project in Java.

The relevant code can be found in `src/main/java/Main.java`, `src/worker/java/`, and `build.gradle`. A template worker is provided for each Worker IO type (O, I, IO, or Auto).

All other files where generated as-is from a new Gradle Java project in IntelliJ.

A `gradle run` task has been added for convenience.
